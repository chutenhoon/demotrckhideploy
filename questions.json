      "passage": "For the past decades, the importance of various ecosystems has become widely understood. Therefore, humans have carried out various methods to protect the natural world, including making the switch to green energy sources.\nSolar energy is harnessed through solar panels and converted into usable electricity. This remarkably efficient energy source generates few harmful emissions, making it a potent tool in reducing our carbon footprint. Furthermore, solar panels are ideally suited for small-scale installations, such as residential homes, as they demand minimal maintenance costs and have a long lifespan. However, the effectiveness of solar power is determined by weather conditions, which makes it less practical in areas where sunny weather is infrequent.\nWind power involves the transformation of wind energy into electricity through the use of large turbines. Wind power produces little greenhouse gases, but it is less suitable for private use due to the consistent maintenance requirements of turbines. Nevertheless, wind farms can be deployed on a large scale and are capable of generating electricity continuously. As a result, there could be increased investments in wind power that could offer a stable energy supply to major cities.\nThe combined forces of wind and solar power play a substantial role in promoting an eco-friendly environment by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, reducing pollution and slowing down the progression of climate change. Moreover, the utilisation of renewable energy sources stimulates investment in sustainable development by creating new career opportunities within the green energy sector.\nToday, the installation and infrastructure costs are the main obstacles to the transition to green energy. However, they offer undeniable benefits that far outweigh their drawbacks, which can help US ensure a more sustainable future.",

      "passage": "Green Living\n[I] Green living, often referred to as sustainable living, encourages individuals to adopt environmentally friendly practices in their daily lives. [II] This lifestyle includes reducing waste, conserving natural resources, and promoting eco-friendly habits, which collectively help to minimize the negative impact on the environment (Davies & Mulligan, 2017). [III] Although green living requires effort and adjustment, its benefits for the planet and future generations are substantial. [IV]\nOne of the fundamental aspects of green living is waste reduction. This can be achieved through practices like recycling, composting, and reducing single-use plastics. According to a report by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), recycling and composting can significantly decrease the amount of waste sent to landfills, which helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pollution (EPA, 2021). Additionally, adopting reusable items such as water bottles and shopping bags minimizes reliance on plastic, which is crucial for protecting ecosystems and wildlife.\nAnother key component of green living is energy conservation. Simple changes, like switching to LED light bulbs and using public transportation, can reduce an individual's carbon footprint. A study by the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows that energy efficiency improvements, if widely implemented, could decrease global energy demand by up to 40% by 2050 (IEA, 2019). By conserving energy, individuals not only lower their utility bills but also contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions, which is essential for mitigating climate change.\nGreen living also involves making conscious choices about the products we consume. This includes opting for sustainably sourced goods, supporting local businesses, and choosing organic produce. Sustainable agriculture practices reduce the need for chemical pesticides and fertilizers, which can harm both the soil and water sources (Smith & Taylor, 2020). By making informed purchases, consumers can support eco-friendly industries and help create a demand for greener alternatives.",

      "passage": "Urban farming, or the practice of growing food within city limits, has gained popularity worldwide. As cities expand and populations grow, there is increasing pressure on food supplies, making urban farming an appealing solution. From rooftop gardens to community plots, urban farms can help produce fresh, local food in areas that are typically food deserts. Additionally, they provide green spaces in densely populated areas, contributing to environmental sustainability.\nUrban farming also has social benefits. It encourages community engagement and provides educational opportunities for residents. People can learn about sustainable agriculture, food production, and environmental conservation. Furthermore, urban farms can offer job opportunities, particularly in underprivileged neighborhoods, where employment options are often limited. By creating jobs and encouraging healthy eating, urban farms positively impact the health and well-being of local communities.\nHowever, urban farming is not without its challenges. One significant issue is space; cities are crowded, and land is scarce. Finding suitable plots for farming can be difficult and expensive. There are also regulatory hurdles, as some cities have strict zoning laws that limit agricultural activities. Additionally, urban soil can be contaminated with pollutants, making it unsuitable for food production. Despite these obstacles, innovative solutions, such as hydroponics and vertical farming, are making urban farming more feasible.\nIn the future, urban farming could play a vital role in food security. As climate change and urbanization continue, local food sources will become increasingly important. By reducing dependency on long supply chains, urban farming can ensure that cities remain resilient in the face of global challenges.",

      "passage": "Urbanisation is a phenomenon that has been occurring rapidly across the globe. As more people move from rural areas to cities in search of better job opportunities, education, and healthcare, the landscape of many countries is changing. While urbanisation brings numerous benefits, such as economic growth and improved infrastructure, it also presents significant challenges. [I]\nOne of the major advantages of urbanisation is the creation of more job opportunities. [II] Moreover, urban areas offer better educational and healthcare facilities, which help improve the quality of life for their residents. [III] In addition, cities often have better access to technology and innovation, enabling them to grow rapidly and attract investments.\nHowever, the rapid pace of urbanisation also leads to several problems. One of the biggest issues is overpopulation, which places a strain on infrastructure and resources. [IV] The increasing demand for housing results in the development of overcrowded areas, leading to a lack of space and poor living conditions for many people. Another consequence of urbanisation is the environmental impact, as cities expand and urban sprawl takes place. Deforestation, air pollution, and the depletion of natural resources are just a few of the negative effects.\nMoreover, the rise of urbanisation often results in social inequality. While some areas within a city flourish, others, especially slums and informal settlements, struggle with poverty and poor living standards. The other side of urban growth is that it can lead to a widening gap between the rich and the poor.\nIn conclusion, urbanisation brings both opportunities and challenges. While it can provide economic growth and improved living standards for many, it can also result in overcrowded cities, environmental damage, and social inequality. Other measures, such as the planning and development of sustainable cities, should be taken to ensure that the benefits of urbanisation are realised without compromising the well-being of citizens and the environment.",
