      "passage": "VI. Read the following passage and mark the letter A, B, C or D to indicate the correct answer to each of the questions from 31 to 40.\n\nUrbanisation is a phenomenon that has been occurring rapidly across the globe. As more people move from rural areas to cities in search of better job opportunities, education, and healthcare, the landscape of many countries is changing. While urbanisation brings numerous benefits, such as economic growth and improved infrastructure, it also presents significant challenges. [I]\n\nOne of the major advantages of urbanisation is the creation of more job opportunities. [II] Moreover, urban areas offer better educational and healthcare facilities, which help improve the quality of life for their residents. [III] In addition, cities often have better access to technology and innovation, enabling them to grow rapidly and attract investments.\n\nHowever, the rapid pace of urbanisation also leads to several problems. One of the biggest issues is overpopulation, which places a strain on infrastructure and resources. [IV] The increasing demand for housing results in the development of overcrowded areas, leading to a lack of space and poor living conditions for many people. Another consequence of urbanisation is the environmental impact, as cities expand and urban sprawl takes place. Deforestation, air pollution, and the depletion of natural resources are just a few of the negative effects.\n\nMoreover, the rise of urbanisation often results in social inequality. While some areas within a city flourish, others, especially slums and informal settlements, struggle with poverty and poor living standards. The other side of urban growth is that it can lead to a widening gap between the rich and the poor.\n\nIn conclusion, urbanisation brings both opportunities and challenges. While it can provide economic growth and improved living standards for many, it can also result in overcrowded cities, environmental damage, and social inequality. Other measures, such as the planning and development of sustainable cities, should be taken to ensure that the benefits of urbanisation are realised without compromising the well-being of citizens and the environment.",
